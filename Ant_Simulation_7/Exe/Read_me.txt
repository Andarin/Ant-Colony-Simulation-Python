Hint 1: Ants have a very limited perception, so if the food is too far away from the 
	colony, they need a longer time to find it.

Hint 2: Par default, "map1.txt" is loaded. It can be stated there which object should be on the board at the beginning.

Hint 3: "genopt.py" starts the genetic algorithm (parameters can be changed within)

Hint 3: System paramters can be changed in the "main.py"

Hint 4: The "brain" of the ant (resp. here utility function) is in Ant_mod.py and can easily be changed.
	The first method is for fast_start == true, the second for fast_start == False

Hint 5: main-fast.exe needs longer to load but is about 30% faster (fast_start = False)
